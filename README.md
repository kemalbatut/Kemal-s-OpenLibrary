# 📚 Kemal's OpenLibrary

A polished **Next.js + React-Bootstrap** project built as part of my WEB422 assignment.  
It integrates with the [OpenLibrary API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to let you:

- 🔎 Search for books by title, ID, or URL  
- 👨‍💻 Explore authors and their works  
- 📅 Sort books by year (latest → oldest or oldest → latest)  
- 🔤 Sort alphabetically (A → Z / Z → A)  
- 🌙 Light & Dark mode support  
- 🔙 Sticky back navigation buttons for smooth exploration  
- ⚡ Deployed with SEO metadata, favicon, and Twitter/Open Graph preview cards
